#### How is the 2019 Databricks Certified Associate Developer Exam graded ?

* The exam is generally graded within 72 hours.
* For multiple choice questions, credit is given for correct answers only - `no penalty for incorrect answers`.
* The standard coding challenges are scored as a whole, with no partial credit.
* The ``capstone`` exercises (generally composed of 3-5 standard coding challenges) are worth proportionally more points but are also graded as a whole. In some cases, partial credit may be awarded depending on the nature of the exercise.
* Both the coding exercises and multiple choice questions are graded automatically.

### How do I prepare for the 2019 Databricks Certified Associate Developer Exam?

1 Instructor-Led Training:
* DB 105 - Apache Spark™ Programming, which covers 100% of the material in the exam

2. Self-Paced Courses:
* SP820: ETL Part 1 – Data Extraction

3. Recommended Reading:
* Spark: The Definitive Guide: Big Data Processing Made Simple Book by Bill Chambers and Matei Zaharia
* Recommended: 3-6 month of hands-on experience working with Apache Spark. While the various offerings above will help with readiness, this exam does require candidates to have a fairly decent command of the core Spark APIs that only comes from hands-on experience.
